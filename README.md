# GoTogether-Smart-Carpooling-System-
🌟 Project Overview
GoTogether is a smart carpooling web application designed to reduce emissions, save costs, and promote sustainable transportation. Built under the EXSEL Project, it aims to tackle the growing environmental crisis caused by excessive automobile emissions by encouraging shared rides, reducing idle vehicle time, and spreading awareness about eco-friendly practices.

🌍 Problem Statement
With rising traffic congestion, fuel wastage, and carbon emissions, the world is facing a serious environmental challenge. Idle vehicles contribute heavily to air pollution, and individual rides increase fuel consumption and costs. GoTogether provides an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative by connecting users for shared rides while promoting emission reduction strategies.

💡 How It Works
🚗 Idle Insights Calculation Example
🔹 User Input:

Distance: 50 km
Average Speed: 50 km/h
Actual Time Taken: 80 minutes (expected was 60 mins)
🔹 Calculation:

Idle Time = Actual Time - Expected Time = 80 - 60 = 20 mins
Fuel Wasted = Idle Time × Fuel Consumption Rate
Emissions Released = Fuel Wasted × Emission Factor (per gas type)
🔹 Displayed Output:
✅ Idle Hours: 0.33 hours
✅ Fuel Wasted: 0.5 liters
✅ CO₂ Emissions Released: 1.15 kg
